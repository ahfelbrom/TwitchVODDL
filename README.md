# backcap-downloader

This is Backcap's downloader for Twitch highlights.
Made by nei (@neistuff), with great help from shounic (@shounic_).

Usage:
* Install youtube-dl.
	You can do it with pip, by typing `python pip install yourube-dl`.
	YOU ONLY NEED TO DO IT THE FIRST TIME THOUGH.
* Put the URL, the start time and the end time of the highlights in highlights.txt.
	This must suit the following format: `url hh:mm:ss hh:mm:ss`. Example: `https://www.twitch.tv/teamfortresstv/v/78990145 0:49:52 0:50:11`
	You can put more than one highlight, just put them in seperate lines.
* Start backcapdownloader.py in a Python interpreter
* The script does the rest, so "????"
* Profit!
	
Enjoy!
